description: "Spirits in Bondage (1919) was C. S. Lewis's first published work (originally\
  \ published under the pseudonym Clive Hamilton, which is Lewis' first name followed\
  \ by his mother's maiden name). Lewis was twenty years old and had just returned\
  \ from military service in the First World War. His tutor, William T. Kirkpatrick,\
  \ encouraged him in publishing the book, although it was unusual at Lewis's age,\
  \ as writers were expected to wait longer before sharing their work with the world.\
  \ The book is subtitled A Cycle of Lyrics and is composed of three different sections\
  \ of poetry. The poems take on several styles and rhythms throughout the book, but\
  \ share common themes. This work stands out among Lewis's writings not only because\
  \ of the focus on poetry rather than prose, but because the author had not yet made\
  \ his conversion to Christianity; therefore the themes and worldviews offered in\
  \ Spirits in Bondage differ greatly from those for which Lewis is most well known.\
  \ The book received no reviews and its reception was a slight disappointment for\
  \ Lewis.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
